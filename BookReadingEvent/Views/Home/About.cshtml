<p font="18px">To implement our learnings from the MVC sessions, we will create an application to manage book-reading events. It will allow managing events across Delhi NCR. A book reading event is where book lovers come together for a community reading of their favourite book. One or more readers read the book loudly and optionally people even play different roles from the book!</p>
